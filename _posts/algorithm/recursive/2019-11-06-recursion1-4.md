**Given a recursion algorithm, its time complexity {\mathcal{O}(T)}O(T) is typically the product of the number of recursion invocations (denoted as {R}R) and the time complexity of calculation (denoted as {\mathcal{O}(s)}O(s)) that incurs along with each recursion call:**

**{\mathcal{O}(T) = R * \mathcal{O}(s)}O(T)=R∗O(s)**
